## Project Overview
This project predicts the winner of football matches in the Women's Super League

## Project Steps
- Scrape match data from [fbref.com](https://fbref.com/en/comps/189/Womens-Super-League-Stats) using requests, BeautifulSoup and pandas
- Clean the data and prepare it for machine learning using pandas
- Make predictions using scikit-learn
- Measure error and improve model predictions

## Next steps:
- To increase the model accuracy:
  - Use matches from all league seasons since 2010
  - Use more predictors including possession, shot-creating actions, goal-creating actions, live-ball passes
  - Include matches from other leagues
